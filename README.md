# mbedTLS-RUST
I have converted one of the module RNG (Random Number Generation) of mbedTLS (written in C) to RUST.<br/>
RUST is more secure and as fast as C language. **mbed TLS** is an open source SSL library licensed by ARM Limited and is an implementation of the TLS and SSL protocols.<br/>

It was a team project. You can view <a href="https://github.com/TPCSS-mbedTLS-Project-2020-22/mbedtls-source/tree/as-ms-ctr-drbg">here</a>
